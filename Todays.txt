Implement A/B Testing Mechanism
Create a component that allows us to compare routing strategies with real user queries.
- Add an `experiments.py` module in the router directory
- Implement functionality to split traffic between different routing algorithms
- Create metrics collection for comparing performance between strategies
- Design a simple dashboard view in the Streamlit app to visualize experiment results


Add Caching Layer for Frequent Queries
Improve performance by implementing intelligent caching.
- Create a `cache.py` module to store frequently asked queries and their responses
- Implement TTL (time-to-live) functionality for cached responses
- Add configurable cache invalidation strategies
- Ensure cached responses include metadata about which provider generated them

Enhance Error Handling and Fallback Chain
Make the system more resilient to API failures.
- Implement a proper error handling system in the base provider class
- Create a fallback chain that tries alternative providers if the primary one fails
- Add automatic retry logic with exponential backoff
- Include detailed error reporting in the response object

Expand the Query Analysis Component
Improve the query understanding capabilities.
- Add sentiment analysis to detect user emotions/urgency
- Implement topic classification to better match domain expertise
- Add language detection for multi-language support
- Create a complexity estimator based on query characteristics


Also a bonus would be if you try implementing a runtime user query analysis system
